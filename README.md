# Question 1: Write up on ML-Models 

### Linear Regression: 
Linear regression is a machine learning model that provides a linear relationship with e dependent and independent variables. It is best used for simple problems where there is a clear linear relationship between features and a target. One downside of using this model is that it is sensitive to outliers in the data. 

### Random Forest:  
Random Forest is another machine learning model that uses decision trees (which is from the name) to make predictions based on the data. The best time to use this is when there are many features that don’t have a linear relationship. Random forests are highly versatile.  

### Gradient Boosting: 
Gradient Boosting is the final model we are going to discuss. It is super interesting and that is where it trains the models in a sequential order and then it tries to correct the previous models making the weak models into stronger models. This is generally used in classification and regression problems. There is a lot of tuning involved in gradient boosting which is prone to overfitting. This makes gradient boosting very accurate but complex to optimize.  

### Retail Question: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) 

For the retail question, we can use a type of boosting model such as AdaBoost. Predicting the Customer Lifetime Value involves estimating a revenue potential overtime. Since this variable is continuous, we need a model that is capable of using complex relationships. The reason why a boosting algorithm such as AdaBoost would work is because they constantly correct errors from the previous models, and they capture complex patterns that the CLV might throw at us. This makes it highly effective for complex retail questions such as Customer Lifetime Values because the patterns aren’t only linear.  


# Question 7: ML Model Application for Cross-Selling  
Cross selling is selling complementary or additional products to a customer and is highly effective in increasing profitability and sales. By analyzing and understanding what product combinations are commonly purchased together, retailers and marketers can utilize cross-selling of these products to enhance their sales. Additionally, cross-selling can improve customer satisfaction and Customer Lifetime Value, further integrating customers and improving the business cycle.


# Question 8: Churn Prediction and Retention  
Customer retention is a company’s ability to obtain and maintain customers that are repeat buyers and do not commonly shop with competitors. Customer retention is important because it builds brand loyalty, maintains profitability, and saves costs on advertising and marketing. Retention strategies to address customers who are at a risk of disengagement include building strong customer loyalty and relationships, creating incentive programs such as loyalty and rewards, and offering quick responses and support to customers in need. There are 16 customers that are at a 100% rate of churning, and 17 more who are above a 50% rate. These are the primary customer groups in which the company should focus on incentivizing and building relationships with.
